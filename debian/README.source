librist for Debian
------------------

The sources have been repacked to exclude non-DFSG-free documentation files
which by themselves were free to be used but which had no preferred form of
modification available. In addition embedded code copies have been removed.

The repackaging is done automagically using debian/copyright's Files-Excluded
in combination with debian/watch and uscan.
